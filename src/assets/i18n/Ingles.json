    "LeyendaP1": "Legend has it that, many years ago, in the State of Nayarit there was once a city called Michiztlán where the king lived with his wife and daughter, a beautiful young woman named Tepozilama, whom the king took great care of..",
    "LeyendaP2": "One day, Tepozilama went for a walk in the company of his ladies, when suddenly, they saw a mortally wounded deer. As they approached to help him, the voice of a handsome young warrior stopped them, to which Tepolizama replied: Who are you and what are you doing here? The young warrior answered: I am Pintontli.",
    "LeyendaP3": "The two young men fell in love knowing that there were problems between the city of Tepozilama and that of Pintontli, but their love was so great that they did not care..",
    "LeyendaP4": "Some time later, during the festivities in the city of Michiztlan, Tepozilama left to see Pintontli. The young woman's father, noticing her absence, questioned her ladies-in-waiting to tell him where the princess was. The king, with his personal guard, went in search of Tepozilama to the place where the ladies had told him, a hidden corner among the warring cities. That was where he found Tepozilama, in the company of Pintontli.",
    "LeyendaP5": "Approaching her father, she said: 'My father, I know my sin is great, but I am in love and I ask that you marry me to him,' to which the king replied: 'My daughter will never be in love with my worst enemies.' . Take her away, tie her up and don't feed her.' They did the same with Pintontli'",
    "LeyendaP6": "Thus, Tepozilama and Pintontli tied, so close but so far away, wept their misfortune for days and nights, until their tears formed the enormous and beautiful lagoon that today is known as the Laguna de Santa María del Oro, in Nayarit, Mexico. .",
    "LeyendaP7": "It is said that Piltontli and Tepozilama are the mountains that surround La Laguna and are facing each other.",
    "Historia": "History",
    "Historia1": "During pre-Hispanic times, the place was completely desolate, nature had gained ground thanks to the null intervention of humans and surrounded the place. In the 12th century the first indigenous groups settled in the area. With the arrival of the Spanish, the native peoples were subdued and the place was used as a passage route to the northwest by order of Francisco Cortés de San Buenaventura, a Spanish soldier and explorer..",
    "Historia2": "During the 18th century, the exploration and exploitation of three mines was carried out, which allowed the development of the population. Due to the importance of the mining industry in the region, this place was called Santa María del Oro..",
    "Historia3": "Because this area is mainly known for its work in the mining, livestock, and agricultural industries, the inhabitants of the municipality were forced to take part in the Mexican Revolution with the intention of stopping the regime of worker exploitation. The mining area of ​​the municipality was the scene of revolutionary struggles.",
    "LaLaguna": "La Laguna",
    "LaLaguna1": "The Laguna de Santa María del Oro is located 10 kilometers from the town of the same name, half an hour by road from Tepic, the capital of Nayarit; and thanks to its proximity, it has shops, clinics, pharmacies and a traditional market with a wide variety of handicrafts made by the Huichols. We recommend you get to El mirador, which is located at the top, before going down to La Laguna, from where you can enjoy a magnificent and enigmatic landscape.",
    "LaLaguna2": "It is a lagoon almost 2.25 kilometers long by 1.2 wide and is located inside a volcanic crater, which is the beginning of the Sierra Madre Occidental. This crater was formed by the fall of a meteorite thousands of years ago",
    "LaLaguna3": "The locals have the story that the bottom of the lagoon had not been found, to which scholars explain that the impact went through deep layers of earth. However, a study found that its depth is 60 meters.",
    "LaLaguna4": "It has a beautiful landscape surrounded by the Sierra Madre Occidental with pine and oak forests and a great variety of fauna with its characteristic Chachalacas and birds of the region..",
    "LaLaguna5": "It contains fresh water that, due to the large amount of minerals and its high level of alkalinity, presents constant color changes that can be seen in shades ranging from blue to bright green, which is why it is known as the Enchanted Lagoon. The temperature of its waters is 25ºC so you can swim peacefully and regenerate your body thanks to its high concentration of volcanic minerals.",
    "LaLaguna6": "If you wish you can camp, practice fishing, diving or water skiing, kayaking and paddle boarding.",
    "LaLaguna7": "Be sure to try their delicious dishes such as fish chicharrones or a fresh fish ceviche.",
